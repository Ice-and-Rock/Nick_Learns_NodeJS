# Nick_Learns_NodeJS
A NodeJS course aimed to practice commands and fun exercises 

Lessons learned:
- Node is great for using Javascript outside of the web browser
- Using streams is a great way to chunk information into smaller pieces
- + This also helps with efficiency of large files
- There are loads of reusable Array methods I already learned when organising data
- reading and writing to individual files can be done using Node
- the movement of data allows you to create, edit or delete entire directories and folders, meaning its a playground for blogs and basic Apps
